OOP: Object Oriented Programming

- Factory Functions
- Object.create()
- Contructor Functions
- Classes


4 PILLARS OF OOP
• Encapsulation - Organizes code into containers that relate to each other and makes 
it easier to maintain and reuse.
• Abstraction - Hides the complexity from the user by doing the method calculations 
behind the scenes.
• Inheritance - Gives the properties of a class to another class, keeping code DRY and 
saving on memory space.
• Polymorphism - The ability of an object to take on many forms allowing methods to 
be used differently by different classes.
